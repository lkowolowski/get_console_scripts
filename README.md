# get_console_scripts
This is a collection of scripts that can be used with [get-console](https://www.get-console.com/shop/)
(either the IOS/Android App, or the Serial console devices themselves).

They can be loaded/syncronized to the device via DropBox or the Enterprise
Server

The scripts are XML files. They can be created in the IOS/Android App, or by
hand, should you wish to hand-craft artisinal XML. A better solution might be
an XSLT transform from a less verbose language.
